Project Information
===================

Overview
--------
- Project: Django app with apps: `content` and `users`.
- Purpose: Media streaming platform with movies, web series, short films, and podcasts.
- Core pages: Home, category lists, watch page, watchlist, profiles, and history.
- Authentication: Required to watch content (`login_required` in watch view).
- Payments: Razorpay keys are present in settings.
- Storage: SQLite database by default in dev.

Structure (high level)
----------------------
- `myproject/`: Django project settings, URLs, WSGI.
- `content/`: Content models, views, templates (watch page, home, etc.).
- `users/`: User profiles, watch history.
- `static/`: CSS and assets.
- `media/`: Uploaded thumbnails and videos.

Key Models
----------
- `Content`: title, description, content_type (movie/webseries/shortfilm/podcast), access_level, category, thumbnail, video_url, video_file, slug, timestamps.
- `Category`: name.
- `SiteConfig`: site_name and logo.

Recent Changes I Made
---------------------
1) Watch Page UI/UX Enhancements
- File: `content/templates/content/watch.html`
- Added responsive mini-player behavior:
  - Video shrinks to a fixed mini player when scrolling down.
  - Returns to original size when scrolling back up.
  - Sticky top mini player on mobile.
- Added spacer to prevent layout flicker when switching to fixed position.
- Added improved meta chips and action buttons.
- Added “More Like This” suggestions section with cards.
- Added “View All” button that links to the full list for the current content type.

2) Related Content Suggestions
- File: `content/views.py`
- Added `related` queryset to the watch view:
  - Now only pulls content from the same `content_type` (e.g., movies show only movies).
- Passed `related` to the watch template.

3) Suppressed 404s for favicon and Chrome devtools file
- File: `myproject/urls.py`
- Added routes that return 204 for:
  - `/favicon.ico`
  - `/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json`

Notes
-----
- If you want a real favicon instead of a 204 response, add a file in `static/` and include it in `base.html`.
- If you want more suggestions or random ordering, we can update the `related` queryset.
